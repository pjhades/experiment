# Day 8

We can encode the instructions as increments on PC and ACC registers:

```
     PC  ACC
nop  +1  +0
jmp  +X  +0
acc  +1  +X
```

where `+X` means increment by the operand.

Then the input program can be represented as a Nx2 array consisting of numbers.

To run the program, we define the running state as:

```
<current PC> <current ACC> <visited>
```

where `visited` is a boolean array indicating whether an instruction in
the program has been executed.

Before executed, the program will be augmented by an identity matrix
so that we can simply add the augmented "code" to our current state
to update PC, ACC and also the visited state.

As an example, the following program:

```
nop +3
jmp +2
acc _4
jmp _1
```

will be encoded and augmented as

```
 1  0  1 0 0 0
 2  0  0 1 0 0
 1 _4  0 0 1 0
_1  0  0 0 0 1
```

Of course in this case the initial state will be:

```
0 0  0 0 0 0
```
